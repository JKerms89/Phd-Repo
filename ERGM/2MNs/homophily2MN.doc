In NL, PL, and IT there is a positive assortivity coefficients. Hence actors tend to invoke their own national community (object). However, this is not the case in the German network. 


logit2prob

NL <- nodematch.org_nat       0.518449281
IT <- nodematch.org_nat         0.603576965     
DE <- nodematch.org_nat         0.3955905  
PL <- nodematch.org_nat         0.619412380

This means that there is a 51% probability that a tie will be formed between two nodes of the same attribute (i.e. nationality). In PL and IT, there is a 60%ish chance.
